Introduction :

In our busy life we are sometimes may not spend too much time making food at home and sometimes we will just chill while having outside food.Some people like a variety of food items.There will be  some situations where we want to eat food early in the morning and late  nights the restaurants are not available, but all the  time we can find food at trucks.To make life easier we thought of ordering food online from trucks.

The Food Truck Management System has three modules: Food Truck, Delivery Boy and the Customer. The Truck can register into the website with their details. The truck needs to provide a verification code (which they receive by email while registering) to verify the account.The Food Truck may change the location details frequently. The truck can update open and closing timings in  a day. The truck will add the food categories that the truck wants to provide on the menu.The truck can view the food categories that are added.The truck can add food items which they can provide.The truck can view added food items. The truck can enable or disable food items.
The customer can register into the websites with their details.The customer needs to provide a verification code (which they receive by email while registering) to verify the account.The customer can login into the website with their credentials. The customer can view the food trucks based on the locations. The customers can browse the food menus of the trucks. The customer can add the food items into the cart. The customer can view the cart details and can place the order with payment, the customers can view their orders. The customers can also cancel their orders before cooking. 
The food truck can view the orders. The food trucks should mark the order status as “cooking” while preparing the food. The food trucks should mark the order status as “cooked” when food is prepared. The delivery boys will receive the delivery requests. When a delivery boy accepts the request, the request will be suspended for the other delivery boys. When the delivery boy reaches the truck. The truck will mark the delivery status as “picked up”. The delivery boy will deliver the order to the customer. The delivery boy will make the status as “delivered to customer”.
